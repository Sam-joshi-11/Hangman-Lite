# 🎯 Hangman Lite – Word Guessing Game in Python

A simple Python-based version of the classic Hangman game where you guess one letter at a time to reveal a hidden word.

---

## 👾 How the Game Works

- The computer randomly picks a secret word like `banana`, `apple`, or `guitar`
- You get **6 lives**
- You guess one letter at a time
- If it's correct ➡️ it's revealed in the word
- If wrong ➡️ you lose a life
- Guess all letters before you run out of lives!

---

## 🧠 What You'll Practice

- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Lists and sets
- `if` conditions
- Live string updates with `_ _ _` placeholders
- Input handling and win/lose logic
